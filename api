It provides a way to abort fetch requests.</p><h4>Why Abort Requests? 🚫</h4><p>Imagine you’re building a search feature for an e-commerce app. Every time a user types a letter (like “w”, then “wi”, then “wir”…), your app sends a new Fetch request. If the user types fast, older requests might resolve <em>after</em> newer ones, causing outdated results to flicker on the screen. Worse, if they leave the page mid-fetch, React might try to update a component that’s already gone, leading to errors.</p><p>By using AbortController, you can cancel pending Fetch requests, ensuring that your application remains efficient.</p><h3>How to Use AbortController with Fetch API</h3><p>Now, let’s see how to use AbortController with React .</p><p><strong>Step 1: Create an AbortController</strong></p><pre>const controller = new AbortController();<br>const signal = controller.signal;</pre><p>The signal property is an AbortSignal object that can be passed to the Fetch API to associate it with the controller.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Pass the Signal to Fetch</strong></p><p>Next, you pass the signal to the fetch function as part of the options object.</p><pre>fetch(&#39;https://api.example.com/data&#39;, { signal })<br>  .then(response =&gt; response.json())<br>  .then(data =&gt; console.log(data))<br>  .catch(error =&gt; {<br>    if (error.name === &#39;AbortError&#39;) {<br>      console.log(&#39;Fetch aborted&#39;);<br>    } else {<br>      console.error(&#39;Fetch error:&#39;, error);<br>    }<br>  });</pre><p><strong>Step 3: Abort the Fetch Request</strong></p><pre>controller.abort();</pre><p>To abort the fetch request, you call the abort method on the AbortController instance.</p><h4>Using AbortController in ReactJS</h4><p>Let’s create a React component for searching products. We’ll use AbortController to cancel outdated searches.</p><pre>import React, { useState, useEffect } from &#39;react&#39;;<br><br>function ProductSearch() {<br>  const [query, setQuery] = useState(&#39;&#39;); // Search input, like &quot;wireless headphones&quot;<br>  const [results, setResults] = useState([]); // Search results<br>  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);<br><br>  useEffect(() =&gt; {<br>    // Step 1: Create the AbortController<br>    const controller = new AbortController();<br>    const { signal } = controller;<br><br>    const fetchResults = async () =&gt; {<br>      if (!query) return; // Don&#39;t search for empty queries<br>      setLoading(true);<br>      try {<br>        // Step 2: Pass the signal to Fetch<br>        const response = await fetch(<br>          `https://api.example.com/products?search=${query}`,<br>          { signal }<br>        );<br>        const data = await response.json();<br>        setResults(data);<br>      } catch (err) {<br>        // Step 3: Handle cancellation gracefully<br>        if (err.name === &#39;AbortError&#39;) {<br>          console.log(&#39;Request aborted!

Each new search creates a fresh AbortController.</li><li><strong>The Cleanup Function</strong>: When the effect re-runs (because query changed) or the component unmounts, React calls controller.abort().

It provides a way to abort fetch requests.\nWhy Abort Requests? 🚫\nImagine you’re building a search feature for an e-commerce app. Every time a user types a letter (like “w”, then “wi”, then “wir”…), your app sends a new Fetch request. If the user types fast, older requests might resolve after newer ones, causing outdated results to flicker on the screen. Worse, if they leave the page mid-fetch, React might try to update a component that’s already gone, leading to errors.\nBy using AbortController, you can cancel pending Fetch requests, ensuring that your application remains efficient.\nHow to Use AbortController with Fetch API\nNow, let’s see how to use AbortController with React .\nStep 1: Create an AbortController\nconst controller = new AbortController();\nconst signal = controller.signal;\nThe signal property is an AbortSignal object that can be passed to the Fetch API to associate it with the controller.\nStep 2: Pass the Signal to Fetch\nNext, you pass the signal to the fetch function as part of the options object.\nfetch('https://api.example.com/data', { signal })\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => console.log(data))\n  .catch(error => {\n    if (error.name === 'AbortError') {\n      console.log('Fetch aborted');\n    } else {\n      console.error('Fetch error:', error);\n    }\n  });\nStep 3: Abort the Fetch Request\ncontroller.abort();\nTo abort the fetch request, you call the abort method on the AbortController instance.\nUsing AbortController in ReactJS\nLet’s create a React component for searching products. We’ll use AbortController to cancel outdated searches.\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nfunction ProductSearch() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState(''); // Search input, like \"wireless headphones\"\n  const [results, setResults] = useState([]); // Search results\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Step 1: Create the AbortController\n    const controller = new AbortController();\n    const { signal } = controller;\n    const fetchResults = async () => {\n      if (!query) return; // Don't search for empty queries\n      setLoading(true);\n      try {\n        // Step 2: Pass the signal to Fetch\n        const response = await fetch(\n          `https://api.example.com/products?search=${query}`,\n          { signal }\n        );\n        const data = await response.json();\n        setResults(data);\n      } catch (err) {\n        // Step 3: Handle cancellation gracefully\n        if (err.name === 'AbortError') {\n          console.log('Request aborted! Moving on...');\n        } else {\n          console.error('Oops!', err);\n        }\n      } finally {\n        setLoading(false);\n      }\n    };\n    fetchResults();\n    // Step 4: Abort if the query changes or the component unmounts\n    return () => controller.abort();\n  }, [query]); // Re-run effect when `query` changes\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        value={query}\n        onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}\n        placeholder=\"Search for products...\"\n      />\n      {loading && <p>Searching for \"{query}\"...</p>}\n      <ul>\n        {results.map((product) => (\n          <li key={product.id}>{product.name}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nexport default ProductSearch;\nBreaking It Down 🔍\n\nThe useEffect Hook: Whenever the user types (updating query), this effect runs. Each new search creates a fresh AbortController.\nThe Cleanup Function: When the effect re-runs (because query changed) or the component unmounts, React calls controller.abort(). This cancels the previous Fetch request if it’s still pending.\nHandling Errors: If a request is aborted, Fetch throws an AbortError. We ignore it because it’s intentional. Real errors (like network failures) are logged for debugging.\n\nPro Tips 💡\n\nAvoid Memory Leaks: Always abort requests when a component unmounts. React’s cleanup function in useEffect is perfect for this.\nDebounce for Extra Smoothness: Combine AbortController with a debounce function (like a 300ms delay) to avoid spamming the API on every keystroke.\nNot Just for Search: Use AbortController for any Fetch call that might become irrelevant — like canceling a file upload when the user closes a modal.\n\nConclusion\nUsing AbortController with the Fetch API in ReactJS is a powerful way to manage and cancel fetch requests. It helps in making your application more efficient and responsive by avoiding unnecessary network requests and potential memory leaks.\nHappy coding!","dc:creator":"Prateek Singh","guid":"https://medium.com/p/70c4a75c99e2","categories":["react","web-development","abortcontroller","javascript","fetch-api"],"isoDate":"2025-02-17T11:47:01.000Z"},{"creator":"Prateek Singh","title":"How to deploy Vite React App to GitHub Pages","link":"https://medium.com/@devxprite/how-to-deploy-vite-react-app-to-github-pages-00e150f73961?source=rss-4416c1da4fe------2","pubDate":"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 01:01:41 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>You can use GitHub Pages to host your website for free.

You should be able to make up to 20 requests within a 5-minute window before receiving a response with a status code of 429.\nhere you will a similar page as show below:\nNormal Page\nAfter refreshing the same URL more that 20 times\nAfter refreshing the same URL more that 20 times\nTo customize the response that is sent when the rate limit is exceeded, you can pass a custom handler function as the handler option in the rate limit middleware. For example:\nconst limiter = rateLimit({\n  windowMs: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes\n  max: 20, // Limit each ip to 20 requests\n  handler: (req, res) => {\n    res.status(429).send({ error: 'Too many requests, please try again later' });\n  }\n});\nThis will send a response with a status code of 429 and a JSON object containing an error message when the rate limit is exceeded.\nYou can also customize the rate limit for specific routes by applying the rate limit middleware only to those routes. For example:\napp.get('/api/users', limiter, (req, res) => {\n  // route logic\n});\nThis will apply the rate limit only to requests made to the /api/users route.\nFull Code\nconst express = require('express');\nconst rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\nconst limiter = rateLimit({\n  windowMs: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes\n  max: 20, // Limit each ip to 20 requests\n  handler: (req, res) => {\n    res.status(429).send({ error: 'Too many requests, please try again later' });\n  }\n});\napp.use(limiter);\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello, World!');\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');\n});\nConclusion\nRate limiting is an important tool for protecting your app from various types of attacks. It’s relatively easy to implement in an express.js application using the express-rate-limit middleware, and it can be customized to fit the needs of your application. While it’s not a foolproof solution, it can provide an important layer of protection for your app.","dc:creator":"Prateek Singh","guid":"https://medium.com/p/7c6b41c0e556","categories":["rate-limiting","nodejs","api","expressjs","brute-force"],"isoDate":"2022-07-29T10:17:46.000Z"}],"repos":[{"name":"infoooze","description":"A OSINT tool which helps you to quickly find information effectively.
